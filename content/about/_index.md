Hi there, I am Anuj, first of all thanks, for visiting the page. It's an honor to serve the community, I am currently working as a Data Scientist/Engineer with Indiaâ€™s leading AgriTech Startup [Agrostar](https://corporate.agrostar.in/). Last year I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) - A Great Place to Learn, Now I am living in Viman Nagar, Pune with my 2 colleagues/batch-mates. My philosophy of life is to solve problems and also provide a helpfull environment to others so that we all can manage conflicts and move in the better directions :).


I'll try my best to keep the content more implementation focused. My current areas of experience are Data Pipeline Architectures and of course automations to get a good night sleep in the mundane routines.
